                    Real estate market is known for its stability and consistent
                    income, which means we don't promote excessive speculative
                    growth or quick, unexpected profits.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our strategy is to provide a high level of reliability for
                    the entire crypto asset market with the added advantage of
                    our token being less susceptible to external shocks. This is
                    because our token is backed by stable income from real
                    estate. As a result, we aim to establish ourselves as the
                    most trustworthy and dependable token in the world over
                    time!
                    <br />
                    <br /> We provide a compelling reason for long-term
                    investment in our token. With a total token supply of 20
                    billion and an unlimited volume for our fund, we ensure a
                    consistent staking yield per token over time. As a result,
                    the token's price on the stock exchange is expected to rise
                    steadily.
                    <br />
                    <br /> How do we plan to achieve this? <br />
                    The total emission of tokens will be divided into three
                    stages:
                    <div className="my-2 rounded-xl bg-gray-100 p-5 dark:bg-gray-600">
                        <ol className="ml-8 list-decimal">
                            <li>
                                {' '}
                                Upon the project launch, a total of{' '}
                                <b>5 billion</b> tokens will be issued. Out of
                                this amount, 2.5 billion tokens will be
                                allocated to the investors, while the remaining
                                2.5 billion tokens will be allocated to the
                                project team.{' '}
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After one year, an additional <b>5 billion</b>{' '}
                                tokens will be issued, and the entire amount
                                will be allocated to the investors.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After another year, the remaining{' '}
                                <b>10 billion</b> tokens will be issued, and
                                they will be distributed to the investors.
                            </li>
                        </ol>{' '}
                    </div>
                    For each token sale to investors, the management company
                    will use the funds to purchase housing. Since this project
                    requires significant capital investment, we will progress
                    through multiple stages of investment, with the majority of
                    housing purchases occurring in the final, third stage of the
                    token sale.
                    <br />
                    <br /> The initial two stages primarily focus on building
                    the project's reputation and gathering essential statistics
                    to attract additional capital. These stages serve as crucial
                    milestones to establish trust and gather necessary data,
                    paving the way for attracting more investment into the
                    project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During the first stage, the plan is to acquire <b>5</b>{' '}
                    rental properties. In the second stage, we aim to expand
                    further by purchasing <b>50</b> properties. Finally, in the
                    third stage, our goal is to acquire <b>500</b> properties.
                    These incremental steps allow us to gradually build up our
                    real estate portfolio and ensure steady growth for the
                    project.
                    <br />
                    <div className="mx-auto my-5 rounded-xl bg-gray-100 p-5 text-center text-2xl font-semibold dark:bg-gray-600 lg:w-2/3">

                    </div>
                    The acquisition of property will not impact the income of
                    the management company or other project team expenses. This
                    ensures that payment volumes remain unaffected. Property
                    acquisition will exclusively occur through the sale of
                    corresponding token amounts on the exchange, with a portion
                    of these funds allocated to marketing efforts.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In the event of a situation on the exchange where the token
                    price experiences a significant increase, possibly due to
                    speculative activity, we will have the opportunity to
                    capitalize on this by selling more tokens at favorable
                    prices. This would allow us to acquire additional
                    properties. Conversely, if the speculative fervor subsides,
                    we'll still have higher token returns than when the boom
                    began. This unique approach sets our project apart,
                    rendering it resilient against adverse shifts in market
                    sentiment.
                    <br />
                    We're not just weathering market swings; we're leveraging
                    them to fuel effective company growth. Each speculative
                    surge becomes an avenue for our expansion, while any
                    downturn merely temporarily decelerates this growth
                    trajectory. Meanwhile, a token price drop triggers an
                    automatic increase in its <i>fast-staking</i> profitability,
                    naturally boosting its popularity. Consequently, our project
                    stands to gain in either scenario.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <div className="my-2 rounded-xl bg-gray-100 p-5 dark:bg-gray-600">
                        The returns for token buyers hinge on the round at which
                        they join our project. Over the course of two years, the
                        token count in circulation will expand fourfold,
                        accompanied by an astounding surge of over 100 times in
                        the number of real estate assets. This substantial
                        growth sets the stage for token yields to potentially
                        skyrocket by a factor of 25, subsequently leading to a
                        comparable increase in their market value on the
                        exchange. These possibilities stand as opportunities for
                        early-round investors â€” this constitutes our proposal
                        tailored to them.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Second-round investors will experience a tangible token
                        growth potential of 5 times (calculated as 500 assets
                        divided by 50 and further divided by the second round),
                        all within a condensed timeframe of one year. This
                        growth is underpinned by heightened reliability,
                        bolstered by the presence of an operational platform and
                        an established management company.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Third-round investors will gain both real estate control
                        and ownership of half of the tokens. This dual advantage
                        promptly enhances the value of their investment right
                        after the deal concludes. Concurrently, the platform and
                        <i>fast-staking</i> technology will have garnered
                        sufficient recognition by this stage, facilitating
                        robust company growth through increased exchange
                        activities.

                    Initially, our management company will focus on real estate
                    located in Israel, specifically Haifa and Tel Aviv. Our
                    future endeavors include expanding into other countries,
                    contingent upon favorable legal conditions. This expansion
                    will incorporate numerous management companies operating
                    under our unified platform.
